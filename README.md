# JavaScriptTest
Use nodejs and mongoDB to build a web app loosely modeled on Spotify, with the following features: ● Register/Login/Logout ● View all songs (including song info like #listens, artist, album) ● Add/Remove song from library ● View library ● View artists and their songs Use a well designed db schema to efficiently perform the above actions (even when scaled). Optional: Use React.js and/or graphql Include as many features as you can, and add more functionality if possible :) Write a function to javascript/node to solve the following problem: Consider a scenario in our web app above: Users can follow other users, and they can follow others (thus creating a network of users). Given a song name and username, identify users in his network that have the given song in their library. We’ll test your code on hidden inputs. Input will be of the following format: First line will contain an int N - no of users The next N2 lines will contain: userID NoOfSongs Song1 Song2 Song3 … The next N 2 lines will contain a userID followed by his follow list. The final line will contain a userID and songID Output all users in the given user’s network that have the given song in their library. Input: Number of users N(int) userID1(int) numberOfSongs K(int) SongId1(int) songid2 songId3 …. SongIdk . . . userID2(int) numberOfSongs m(int) SongId1 songid2 songId3 …. SongIdm UserID1 userID2 UserID3 . . UserId1 SongId2 Input: 4 112112 3 1 2 3 100100 5 3 77 33 9 8 111110 2 99 77 666666 1 3 112112 100100 111110 110110 666666 111110 112112 100100 666666 111110 112112 3 Output: 100100 666666
